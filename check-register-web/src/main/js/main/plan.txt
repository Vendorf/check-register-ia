[A: Removed getSummary as independent]
In CheckTableComponent, currently am retrieving summary separately from the CheckTableComponent

This is okay to leave as there might be a use case for getting summary independently, but there isn't really
a reason to just get the checks without getting the summary

It would be better to add a tag that you send to the server to Suppress Summary if there ever is a need for it,
and in the CheckBook.java class there will be a way to build without the summary so that it simply sends with checks
and null for summary

This will help simplify code but more importantly cuts the number of DB calls in half as don't have to separately retrieve the
checks for sending the checks and then separately for calculating the summary to send it
[--------------------

[B: CheckRow editing fix]
So editing isn't retarded on slow connection, should change it to suppress sending unless the input is not in focus, and only then
does it send and update with the websocket response; until then just set the whole state with the value from the input



wait nvm, probably because of null on this:
yup it was null, now Builder.Default on transactionName and memo is empty string "" and it renders properly:
because there is no change from initial to final state, react doesn't re-render and so the application is still functional
but once there are different responses it will actually work correctly

this is if anything actually really nice and working as intended I'm sure, as it would prevent clearing if it took a while for
something to change, so it wouldn't just delete
