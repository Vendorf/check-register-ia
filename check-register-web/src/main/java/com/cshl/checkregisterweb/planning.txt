front end:

subscriber model for updating UI
have globalRefreshEvent which all subscribe to to force unilateral refresh (ex: changing users or some other major change
where everything should update just in case or by necessity)

userChange should probably cause a hard reload of everything honestly; perhaps cause a global reset of all UI
    for now, just not going to worry about it until multiple users become a reality then can update code to fit that paradigm
